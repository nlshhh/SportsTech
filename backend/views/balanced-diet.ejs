      <h2 class="section-title">The Balanced Diet Required by the Body</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          A balanced diet is essential for good health, providing your body with the nutrients it needs in the right proportions.
          It includes carbohydrates for energy, proteins for growth and repair, and healthy fats for brain function. Vitamins, minerals, and fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains support digestion and immunity.
          Water keeps the body hydrated, while limiting processed foods, added sugars, and excess salt helps maintain overall balance.

      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Daily calorie needs vary by age, gender, activity level, and goals. Men typically require 2,000–3,000 calories, women need 1,600–2,400, and children 1,200–2,000.
          Active individuals need more, while those seeking weight loss require fewer calories. Ensure your intake comes from nutritious sources and consult a professional for personalized advice.

      <h2 class="section-title">Ideal eating times for maximum energy.</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>A healthy eating schedule includes balanced meals and snacks at specific times. Start with breakfast (7-9 AM), contributing 20-25% of daily calories with protein, whole grains, and fruits. Have a light mid-morning snack (10-11 AM), about 5-10%, such as nuts or yogurt. Lunch (12-2 PM) should be the largest meal, providing 30-35% of daily calories with lean protein, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. An afternoon snack (3-4 PM), around 5-10%, can include fruits or nuts. Dinner (6-8 PM) should be lighter, 25-30%, with lean protein, veggies, and minimal carbs. An optional evening snack (8-9 PM), about 5%, can include fruit or milk. Avoid heavy meals late at night.</p>
